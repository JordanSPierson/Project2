# Project2

Howdy,

Team "Dynamic Array Allocation Is Hard" (Jordan Pierson and Todd Muller) 
completed this program for Project 02 of COSC 2030 in Fall Semester 2018 at
the University of Wyoming (UW). It creates a tracking tree, represented in 
an array of type Node (a class) which stores information 
and hashes about the node itself, it's parent, and it's children. 
We used the visualize function to verify that it works.

Happy Holidays!
